# FastCGI Spec

Since fastcgi.com is not available anymore, I ([fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev)) created this repository and linked website [fast-cgi.github.io](https://fast-cgi.github.io) to host the FastCGI Spec.

## Contents

This repository contains two version of the specification:

  * The original version from fastcgi.com, pulled from the Wayback Machine archive, at [original/spec.html](original/spec.html)

  * A markdown version, manually converted from the original, at [spec.md](spec.md). Text and most formatting in this version is identical to the original, the only exception being the [References](spec.md#9-references) section: there, after the original text, a subsection has been added with live links to updated sources.

Visit [the website](https://fast-cgi.github.io) to read a nicely formatted version of the spec.
